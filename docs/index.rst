COE 332: Software Engineering & Design
======================================

The objective of this course is to introduce students to more advanced computing
concepts in software engineering, software systems design, cloud computing and
distributed systems, and computational engineering. Through a series of
assignments spanning the course of the semester, students will build a
cloud-based, computational system to analyze a time series dataset and provide a
web-accessible interface to their system.
