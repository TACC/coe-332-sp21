Week 1: Onboarding, Linux, Python Review
========================================

We will use the first week of class to set expectations and describe
requirements for the upcoming semester. We will begin to set up some necessary
accounts and onboard students to the TACC / class ecosystem. We will also
quickly review essential Linux and Python skills that will be necessary for the
rest of this course.
