Week 8: Intro to Databases and Persistence, Containerizing Redis
================================================================

In this eighth week of class, we will begin implementing a database using Redis
to hold our data sets such that they persist beyond the lifetime of a container.
We will also figure out how to query our data in Python by connecting our Flask
API to our Redis database, and containerize both of our services.
