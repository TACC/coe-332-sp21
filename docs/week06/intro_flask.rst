Introduction to Flask
=====================

Flask is a Python library and framework for building web servers. Some of the
defining characteristics of Flask make it a good fit for this project:

* Flask is small and lightweight - relatively easy to use and get setup initially
* Flask is robust - a great fit for REST APIs and **microservices**
* Flask is performant - when used correctly, it can handle the traffic of sites
  with 100Ks of users

In this section, we will get a brief introduction into Flask, including how to
set up a quick REST API with multiple routes (URLs). After going through this
module, students should be able to:

* Install the Flask Python library and import it into a Python script
* Define and give function to various routes in a Flask Python script
* Run a local Flask development server
* Curl defined routes from the local Flask server

Wait - What is a Microservice?
------------------------------

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an
architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services
that are:

* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities

The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of
large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its
technology stack. Many heavily-trafficked, well-known sites use microservices
including Netflix, Amazon, and eBay.

There is a great article on DevTeam.Space
`about microservices <https://www.devteam.space/blog/microservice-architecture-examples-and-diagram/>`_.


Setup and Installation
----------------------

The Flask library is not part of the Python standard library but can be
installed standard tools like ``pip3``. In addition to making Flask available to
import into a Python script, it will also expose some new command line tools. On
the class server, perform the following:

.. code-block:: console

   [isp02]$ pip install --user flask
   ...
   Successfully installed flask-1.1.2

   [isp02]$ flask --help
   Usage: flask [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

   A general utility script for Flask applications.

   Provides commands from Flask, extensions, and the application. Loads the
   application defined in the FLASK_APP environment variable, or from a
   wsgi.py file. Setting the FLASK_ENV environment variable to 'development'
   will enable debug mode.

     > export FLASK_APP=hello.py
     > export FLASK_ENV=development
     > flask run

   Options:
     --version  Show the flask version
     --help     Show this message and exit.

   Commands:
     routes  Show the routes for the app.
     run     Run a development server.
     shell   Run a shell in the app context.


.. tip:

   If you aren't already using a virtual environment to help manage your Python
   libraries, now is a `good time to start <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_!


A Hello World Flask App
-----------------------

In a new directory on the class server, create a file called ``app.py`` and open
it for editing. Enter the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:

   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # the next statement should usually appear at the bottom of a flask app
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')

On the first line, we are importing the Flask class.

On the third line, we create an instance of the Flask class (called ``app``).
This so-called "Flask application" object holds the primary configuration and
behaviors of the web program.

Finally, the ``app.run()`` method launches the development server. The
``debug=True`` option tells Flask to print verbose debug statements while the
server is running. The ``host=0.0.0.0`` option instructs the server to listen
on all network interfaces; basically this means you can reach the server from
inside and outside the host VM.


Run the Flask App
-----------------

There are two main ways of starting the Flask service. For now, we recommend you
start the service using a unique port number. The ``-p 5000`` indicates that
Flask is running on port 5000. You will need to use your own assigned port.

.. warning::

   Check Slack or ask the instructors which port you should use. Trying to run
   two Flask apps on the same port will not work.

.. code-block:: console

    [isp02]$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
    [isp02]$ export FLASK_ENV=development
    [isp02]$ flask run -p 5000
     * Serving Flask app "app.py" (lazy loading)
     * Environment: development
     * Debug mode: on
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
     * Restarting with stat
     * Debugger is active!
     * Debugger PIN: 182-299-771

That's it! We now have a server up and running. Some notes on what is happening:

* Note that the program took over our shell; we could put it in the background,
  but for now we want to leave it in the foreground. (Multiple PIDs are started
  for the Flask app when started in daemon mode; to get them, find all processes
  listening on the port 5000 socket with ``lsof -i:5000``).
* If we make changes to our Flask app while the server is running in development
  mode, the server will detect those changes automatically and "reload"; you will
  see a log to the effect of ``Detected change in <file>``.
* We can stop the program with ``Ctrl+C`` just like any other (Python) program.
* If we stop our Flask programs, the server will no longer be listening and our
  requests will fail.

Next we can try to talk to the server using ``curl``. Note this line:

.. code-block:: console

     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

That tells us our server is listening on the ``localhost`` - ``127.0.0.1``, and
on the default Flask port, port ``5000``.


Ports Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ports are a concept from networking that allow multiple services or programs to
be running at the same time, listening for messages over the internet, on the
same computer.

* For us, ports will always be associated with a specific IP address. In
  general, we specify a port by combining it with an IP separated by a colon (:)
  character. For example, ``129.114.97.16:5000``.
* One and only one program can be listening on a given port at a time.
* Some ports are designated for specific activities; Port 80 is reserved for
  HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS (encrypted HTTP), but other ports can be used for
  HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

curl Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can think of ``curl`` as a command-line version of a web browser: it is just
an HTTP client.

* The basic syntax is ``curl <some_url>:<some_port>``. This will make a ``GET``
  request to the URL and port print the message response.
* Curl will default to using port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
* You can specify the HTTP verb to use with the ``-X`` flag; e.g.,
  ``curl -X GET <some_url>`` (though ``-X GET`` is redundant because that is the
  default mode).
* You can set "verbose mode" with the ``-v`` flag, which will then show
  additional information such as the headers passed back and forth (more on this
  later).


Make a Request
--------------

Because the terminal window running your Flask app is currently locked to that
process, the simplest thing to do is open up a new terminal and SSH into the
class server again.

To make a request to your Flask app, type the following in the new terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   [isp02]$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000
   - or -
   [isp02]$ curl localhost:5000


You should see the following response:

.. code-block:: console

   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
   <title>404 Not Found</title>
   <h1>Not Found</h1>
   <p>The requested URL was not found on the server.  If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>

Our server is sending us HTML! It's sending a 404 that it could not find the
resource we requested. Although it appears to be an error (and technically it
is), this is evidence that the Flask server is running successfully. It's time
to add some routes.


.. note::

   Only one Flask app can be associated with each port. The default port above
   (5000) is an example. Please make sure to run your Flask server on the port
   assigned to you (``flask run -p 50xx``). You can curl your own port number,
   or you can curl other people's Flask servers by subbing in their port number.


Routes in Flask
---------------

In a Flask app, you define the URLs in your application using the ``@app.route``
decorator. Specifications of the ``@app.route`` decorator include:

* Must be placed on the line before the declaration of a Python function.
* Requires a string argument which is the path of the URL (not including the base
  URL)
* Takes an argument ``methods`` which should be a list of strings containing the
  names of valid HTTP methods (e.g. ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``)

When the URL + HTTP method combination is requested, Flask will call the
decorated function.


Tangent: What is a Python Decorator?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A decorator is a function that takes another function as an input and extends
its behavior in some way. The decorator function itself must return a function
which includes a call to the original function plus the extended behavior. The
typical structure of a decorator is as follows:

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:

   def my_decorator(some_func):

       def func_to_return():

           # extend the behavior of some_func by doing some processing
           # before it is called (optional)
           do_something_before()

           # call the original function
           some_func(*args, **kwargs)

           # extend the behavior of some_func by doing some processing
           # after it is called (optional)
           do_something_after()

       return func_to_return

As an example, consider this test program:

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:

   def print_dec(f):
       def func_to_return(*args, **kwargs):
           print("args: {}; kwargs: {}".format(args, kwargs))
           val = f(*args, **kwargs)
           print("return: {}".format(val))
           return val
       return func_to_return

   @print_dec
   def foo(a):
       return a+1

   result = foo(2)
   print("Got the result: {}".format(result))

Our ``@print_dec`` decorator gets executed automatically when we call ``foo(2)``.
Without the decorator, the final output would be:

.. code-block:: text

   Got the result: 3

By using the decorator, however, the final output is instead:

.. code-block:: text

   args: (2,); kwargs: {}
   return: 3
   Got the result: 3


Define the Hello World Route
----------------------------

The original Flask app we wrote above (in ``app.py``) did not define any routes.
Let's define a "hello world" route for the base URL. Meaning if someone were to
curl against the base URL (``/``) of our server, we would want to return the
message "Hello, world!". To do so, add the following lines to your ``app.py``
script:

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7

   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, world!\n'

   # the next statement should usually appear at the bottom of a flask app
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')

The ``@app.route`` decorator on line 5 is expecting ``GET`` requests at the base
URL ``/``. When it receives such a request, it will execute the ``hello_world()``
function below it.

In your active SSH terminal, execute the curl command again (you may need to
restart the Flask app); you should see:

.. code-block:: console

   [isp02]$ curl localhost:5000/
   Hello, world!


Routes with URL Parameters
--------------------------

Flask makes it easy to create Routes (or URLs) with variables in the URL. The
variable name simply must appear in angled brackets (``<>``) within the
``@app.route()`` decorator statement; for example:

.. code-block:: python3

   @app.route('/<year>')

Would grant the function below it access to a variable called ``year``

In the following example, we extend our ``app.py`` Flask app by adding a route
with a variable (``<name>``):

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9-11

   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, world!\n'

   @app.route('/<name>', methods=['GET'])
   def hello_name(name):
       return f'Hello, {name}!\n'

   # the next statement should usually appear at the bottom of a flask app
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')

Now, the Flask app supports multiple routes with different functionalities:

.. code-block:: console

   [isp02]$ curl localhost:5000/
   Hello, world!
   [isp02]$ curl localhost:5000/joe
   Hello, joe!
   [isp02]$ curl localhost:5000/jane
   Hello, jane!




EXERCISE
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This exercise will be reflected in Homework 03, parts A and B.

Using your creature creator dataset, use your get_data() function that reads in
your data set into a dictionary.

.. code-block:: python3

    def get_data():
        ....

You job is to create an API to manage that database. We need to think through
the following:

* What are the nouns in our application?
* What are the routes we want to define?
* What data format do we want to return?

**Part A:** Create some new ``GET`` routes for the nouns identified in the
database above. Find your nouns, make at least 3 routes to retrieve the nouns
from your JSON data.

**Part B:** Write tests for your routes.
